# BookHeart - Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 2026**

## Overview

BookHeart is an offline-first book tracking app. Your data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.

## Data Storage

All your books, reading sessions, goals, plants, and settings are stored in a local database (SQLite) on your device. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly use the Backup & Restore feature.

## Camera Permission

BookHeart requests camera access solely for scanning book barcodes (ISBN). No photos or videos are captured, stored, or transmitted. Camera access is optional and can be denied without affecting other app features.

## Network Usage

When you look up a book by ISBN, BookHeart sends the ISBN number to the Google Books API to retrieve book metadata (title, author, cover image). No personal data or device identifiers are included in these requests. The app functions fully offline without this feature.

## Third-Party Services

BookHeart does not include any advertising, analytics, or tracking SDKs. The only external service used is the Google Books API for optional book metadata lookup.

## Data Deletion

You can delete all your data at any time using the "Delete All Data" option in Settings. Uninstalling the app also removes all stored data from your device.

## Children's Privacy

BookHeart does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app does not require account creation or any personal information to function.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in app updates. The "Last updated" date at the top indicates the most recent revision.
