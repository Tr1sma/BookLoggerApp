# Privacy Policy for Book Logger

**Last Updated:** December 4, 2024

## Introduction

Book Logger ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application designed to help you track your reading progress, manage your book collection, and achieve your reading goals. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Data Controller

This app is developed and maintained by an independent developer. For privacy-related inquiries, please contact us through the app store listing.

## Information We Collect

### Data You Provide

The app stores the following information that you enter:

- **Book Information:** Title, author, ISBN, publisher, publication year, page count, cover images, genres, and descriptions
- **Reading Progress:** Current page, reading sessions (date, duration, pages read)
- **Personal Notes:** Quotes, annotations, and book ratings
- **Reading Goals:** Your personal reading targets and progress
- **Gamification Data:** Virtual plants, experience points, levels, and coins earned through reading

### Automatically Collected Data

- **Usage Statistics:** Reading streaks, total pages read, and reading time (calculated locally)

### Data NOT Collected

We do **NOT** collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Analytics or tracking data
- Crash reports sent to external servers

## How We Use Your Information

All data is used solely to:
- Display your book collection and reading progress
- Track and visualize your reading statistics
- Manage your reading goals
- Provide the gamification features (plants, XP, levels)

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

**All your data is stored locally on your device.** We use a SQLite database stored in your device's private application directory. This means:

- Your data never leaves your device (except for Google Books API queries)
- We do not have access to your data
- We do not operate any servers that store your information
- Uninstalling the app will delete all locally stored data

### Data Export

You can export your data at any time in JSON or CSV format through the app's settings. This allows you to:
- Create personal backups
- Transfer data to other devices
- Review all stored information

## Third-Party Services

### Google Books API

When you use the ISBN lookup feature, the app queries the Google Books API to retrieve book metadata (title, author, description, cover image, etc.).

- **Data Sent:** Only the ISBN number you scan or enter
- **Data Received:** Public book information from Google's database
- **Google's Privacy Policy:** https://policies.google.com/privacy

No personal data or reading habits are shared with Google through this feature.

## Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Internet** | Required for ISBN lookup via Google Books API |
| **Camera** | Used to scan ISBN barcodes (optional feature) |
| **Flashlight** | Used to illuminate barcodes in low light (optional) |

You can deny camera permission and still use the app by entering ISBNs manually.

## Data Retention

Your data is retained on your device until you:
- Delete individual books or reading sessions
- Use the "Delete All Data" feature in Settings
- Uninstall the application

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access:** View all your data within the app
- **Export:** Download your data in JSON or CSV format
- **Delete:** Remove individual entries or all data at once
- **Portability:** Export and use your data elsewhere

### How to Delete Your Data

1. Open the app
2. Navigate to **Settings**
3. Scroll to **Danger Zone**
4. Tap **Delete All Data**
5. Type "DELETE" to confirm

This permanently removes all books, reading sessions, goals, plants, and progress.

## Children's Privacy

Book Logger does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app does not require account creation or personal information to function.

## Security

We implement appropriate security measures:
- All data is stored in the app's private directory, inaccessible to other apps
- No data transmission to external servers (except Google Books API)
- No user accounts or authentication required

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Open Source

The app's data handling can be verified through the source code. No hidden data collection or tracking is implemented.

## Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the app's data practices, please contact us through:
- The app store listing's developer contact
- GitHub issues (if applicable)

## Summary

- **All data stays on your device**
- **No accounts required**
- **No analytics or tracking**
- **No data sold or shared**
- **Full data export and deletion available**
- **Only Google Books API is contacted (for ISBN lookup only)**
